# Assets for the board documentation

This folder is intended to hold all the assets needed for the documentation under the "board" category

Some examples of what you would put in here are any images or pdfs, and maybe a 3d model of the whole assembly

I've found the following html useful when inserting images into the documentation:

    <figure style="max-width: 400px;" class="align-center">
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/assets/image.jpg"/>
    </figure>
