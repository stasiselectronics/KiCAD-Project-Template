<h4>Welcome to the Documentation Webiste!</h4>


This webiste is dedicated to hosting the documentation template for my designs here at Stasis Electronics.

The website is being deployed on gh-pages 

- View the [source files]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) on github

The theme for the website is based off of the wonderful Jekyll theme "Minimal Mistakes" by [Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/)
