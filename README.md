# Open Source Hardware Pages Template

This branch of the repository contains all the source files for the documentation website. The content is mostly written in markdown files that are then used by jekyll to generate the static website.


## Jekyll

The site is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) theme for jekyll. It is designed, developed, and maintained by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/) from Buffalo New York.

## Deploying the site for local development

If you would like to deploy the site locally to see changes quicker, you can use this guide from github:

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:
