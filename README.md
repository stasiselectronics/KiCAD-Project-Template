# Open Source Hardware Pages Template

I wanted to create a pages template for my open source hardware projects to help with documentation, sharing, and posting about it's development.

This template uses the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme, and is intended to be used with github pages. Though, there's nothing stopping you from hosting it on your own domain.

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
